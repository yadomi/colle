# Colle

## Motivation

Paste 2 is a very powerfull tool, it's has good native feeling and is very efficient as a clipboard manager tool. However, beside the fact it wasn't cheap at first (about 20â‚¬) it is now a subscription based pricing, which is ridiculus.

Colle try to be an easy and free alternative to Paste, coded with rage in a very short period of time.
