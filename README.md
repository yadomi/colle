## Motivation

Paste 2 is a very powerfull tool, it's a very efficient as a clipboard manager tool. However beside the fact it wasn't cheap at first (about 20â‚¬) it is now a subscription based pricing, which is ridiculus. Colle is a Paste 2 inspirated application, based on Electron.

Q: What's in on top and not at the bottom like Paste ?
